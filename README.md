# Controlling-six-ServoMotors-by-UltraSonic-and-display-it-on-the-LCD

This circuit is a robot's arm. The circuit consists of six servomotors, each of which has an initial degree value of zero. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic will measure the distanceo and based on the signals our motors will move. The measured distance from the ultrasonic is displayed on the LCD, as well as a distinct message for each scenario.
